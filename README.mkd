Solarized Colorscheme for Mate Terminal
========================================

Scripts for setting the Solarized color set with Mate Terminal.

This is nothing more than a fork of sigurdga's original [Gnome Terminal Colors Solarized repository] with some basic search-and-replace applied.

Colors
------

Only the foreground, background and highlight colors are different in the light
and dark color sets, as one of the main ideas behind Ethan Schonoover's work is
to use the same colors in the palette for both.

If you are not happy, you can change which colors are used for what in the
shell. This can be done by using [ls-colors-solarized].

See the [Solarized homepage] for theory behind the colors, screenshots, details
and colorscheme versions for Vim, Mutt, popular terminal emulators and other
applications.
